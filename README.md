# Home Assistant Raspberry Pi GPIO PWM custom integration

**This is a spin-off from the original Home Assistant integration which was marked as deprecated and will be removed in Home Assistant Core 2022.4.**

The rpi_gpio_pwm platform allows to control multiple lights using pulse-width modulation, for example LED strips. It supports one-color, RGB and RGBW LEDs driven by GPIOs of a Raspberry Pi (same host or remote) or a PCA9685 controller.

For controlling the GPIOs, the platform connects to the pigpio-daemon (http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/pigpiod.html), which must be running. On Raspbian Jessie 2016-05-10 or newer the pigpio library is already included. On other operating systems it needs to be installed first (see installation instructions: https://github.com/soldag/python-pwmled#installation).

For Home Assistant this daemon can be installed as an add-on (https://github.com/Poeschl/Hassio-Addons/tree/master/pigpio).

# Installation

### HACS

The recommend way to install `ha-rpi_gpio_pwm` is through [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/).

### Manual installation

Copy the `ha-rpi_gpio_pwm` folder and all of its contents into your Home Assistant's `custom_components` folder. This folder is usually inside your `/config` folder. If you are running Hass.io, use SAMBA to copy the folder over. You may need to create the `custom_components` folder and then copy the `ha-rpi_gpio_pwm` folder and all of its contents into it.

# Configuration
To enable this platform, add the following lines to your configuration.yaml:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: rpi_gpio_pwm
    leds:
      - name: Lightstrip Cupboard
        driver: gpio
        pins: [17]
        type: simple
```
# CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
- **leds** list *(REQUIRED)*: Can contain multiple LEDs.

- **name** string *(REQUIRED)*: The name of the LED.

- **driver** string *(REQUIRED)*: The driver which controls the LED. Choose either gpio or pca9685.

- **pins** list | integer *(REQUIRED)*: The pins connected to the LED as a list. The order of pins is determined by the specified type.

- **type** string *(REQUIRED)*: The type of LED. Choose either rgb, rgbw or simple.

- **frequency** integer *(optional, default: 200)*: The PWM frequency.

- **address** string *(optional, default: 64)*: The address of the PCA9685 driver.

- **host** string *(optional, default: localhost)*: The remote host address for the GPIO driver.

- **port** integer *(optional, default: 8888)*: The port on which the GPIO driver is listening.

# Examples
In this section you find some real-life examples of how to use this sensor.

RGB LED CONNECTED TO PCA9685 CONTROLLER
This example uses a PCA9685 controller (https://www.nxp.com/products/interfaces/ic-bus-portfolio/ic-led-display-control/16-channel-12-bit-pwm-fm-plus-ic-bus-led-controller:PCA9685) to control a RGB LED.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: rpi_gpio_pwm
    leds:
      - name: TV Backlight
        driver: pca9685
        pins: [0, 1, 2] # [R, G, B]
        type: rgb
```

RGBW LED CONNECTED TO PCA9685 CONTROLLER
This example uses a PCA9685 controller (https://www.nxp.com/products/interfaces/ic-bus-portfolio/ic-led-display-control/16-channel-12-bit-pwm-fm-plus-ic-bus-led-controller:PCA9685) to interact with a RGBW LED.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: rpi_gpio_pwm
    leds:
      - name: Lightstrip Desk
        driver: pca9685
        pins: [3, 4, 5, 6] # [R, G, B, W]
        type: rgbw
```

RGB LED CONNECTED TO THE GPIO PINS OF A REMOTE RASPBERRY PI.
On the Raspberry Pi the pigpio daemon is running on the custom port 6666.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: rpi_gpio_pwm
    leds:
      - name: Lightstrip Sideboard
        driver: gpio
        host: 192.168.0.66
        port: 6666
```
